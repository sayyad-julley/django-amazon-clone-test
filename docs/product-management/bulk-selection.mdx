## Bulk Product Selection

In the Product List page, you can now select multiple products at once using the "Select All" checkbox:

### Features

- A "Select All Products" checkbox is available at the top of the product list
- Clicking this checkbox will check/uncheck all individual product checkboxes
- Each product has its own checkbox for granular selection
- Useful for performing bulk actions on multiple products

### Usage

1. Navigate to the Product List page
2. Use the "Select All" checkbox in the header to quickly select or deselect all products
3. Alternatively, select individual products as needed

### Example

```html
<!-- HTML structure for bulk selection -->
<div class="custom-control custom-checkbox">
    <input type="checkbox" class="custom-control-input" id="selectAllProducts">
    <label class="custom-control-label" for="selectAllProducts">Select All Products</label>
</div>

<!-- Individual product checkbox -->
<div class="custom-control custom-checkbox">
    <input type="checkbox" class="custom-control-input product-checkbox"
           id="product_123"
           name="product_ids"
           value="123">
    <label class="custom-control-label" for="product_123">
        Select Product
    </label>
</div>
```

**Note**: This feature enhances user experience by providing a quick way to select multiple products for bulk operations.
