# Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides a centralized view for administrators to monitor the e-commerce platform.

## Dashboard Home Page

The admin dashboard home page (`/admin_home/`) displays key statistics about the platform.

### Features

#### Total Products Count

The dashboard displays the total number of products in the system.

**Implementation Details:**

- **View:** `admin_home` function in `DjangoEcommerceApp/AdminViews.py`
- **Template:** `DjangoEcommerceApp/templates/admin_templates/home.html`

**Usage:**

When an admin user logs in and navigates to the admin home page, they will see:

```
Total Products: [count]
```

Where `[count]` is the current number of products in the database.

**Technical Implementation:**

```python
@login_required(login_url="/admin/")
def admin_home(request):
    total_products = Products.objects.count()
    context = {'total_products': total_products}
    return render(request, "admin_templates/home.html", context)
```

### Dynamic Updates

The product count updates automatically whenever:
- A new product is added to the system
- A product is removed from the system

No page refresh is required beyond the initial load to see the current count.
