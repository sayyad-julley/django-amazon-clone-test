## Form Help Text Update

In this update, we added help text to various form input fields to provide users with clearer guidance on how to fill out the forms.

### Changes Made
- Added help text for `url_slug` fields across category and subcategory forms
- Added help text for `product_name` and `brand` fields in product forms

### Specific Help Text Examples
- `url_slug`: "Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only"
- `product_name`: "Enter the full product name as it should appear to customers"
- `brand`: "Enter the manufacturer or brand name"

### Benefits
- Improves user understanding of input requirements
- Reduces potential user errors
- Provides context for form fields

### Implementation Details
The help text was added using `<small class="form-text text-muted">` tags, which provide a subtle, muted styling that doesn't distract from the main form interface.
