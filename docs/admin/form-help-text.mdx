## Form Field Help Text

In the Django Amazon Clone project, we've added helpful hint text to various admin form fields to guide users on what information to enter:

### Category and Subcategory Forms
- **URL Slug Field**: 
  - Help Text: "Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only"
  - Purpose: Ensure consistent and URL-friendly slug creation

### Product Forms
- **Product Name Field**:
  - Help Text: "Enter the full product name as it should appear to customers"
  - Purpose: Ensure accurate and complete product naming

- **Brand Field**:
  - Help Text: "Enter the manufacturer or brand name"
  - Purpose: Clarify the type of information required in the brand field

## Implementation Details
- Help text is implemented using the `<small class="form-text text-muted">` HTML element
- Positioned directly below the corresponding input field
- Uses a muted/grey color to provide guidance without being too intrusive
