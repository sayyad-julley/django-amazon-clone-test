# Product List Admin View

## Status Badge Feature

The product list now includes a Status column that displays the active/inactive state of each product.

### Status Badge Representation

- **Active Products**: Green badge with "Active" text
- **Inactive Products**: Grey badge with "Inactive" text

### Implementation Details

- Located in: `DjangoEcommerceApp/templates/admin_templates/product_list.html`
- Uses Bootstrap badge classes for styling
- Conditional rendering based on `is_active` field

### Example

```html
{% if product.product.is_active == 1 %}
    <span class="badge badge-success">Active</span>
{% else %}
    <span class="badge badge-secondary">Inactive</span>
{% endif %}
```

### Changelog
