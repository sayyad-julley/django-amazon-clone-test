## Recent Changes

### AGENTIC-114: Added Back to Product List Navigation

A "Back to Product List" button has been added to both the product create and edit pages to improve navigation:

- **Location**: Bottom of the form, next to the submit button
- **Styling**: Secondary button style (`btn-secondary`)
- **Behavior**: Navigates to the product list page using Django's URL routing

This enhancement improves the user experience by providing a clear path back to the product list without requiring browser navigation.
