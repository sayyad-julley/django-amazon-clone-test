## Product Status Badge

In the admin product list, each product now displays a status badge indicating whether it is Active or Inactive.

### Badge Types
- **Active Badge**: Green badge displaying "Active"
  - Appears when `is_active` is set to 1
- **Inactive Badge**: Grey badge displaying "Inactive"
  - Appears when `is_active` is set to 0

### Implementation Details
The status badge is added to the product card in the admin product list template, providing a quick visual indicator of the product's current status.

Example:
```html
{% if product.product.is_active == 1 %}
    <span class="badge badge-success">Active</span>
{% else %}
    <span class="badge badge-secondary">Inactive</span>
{% endif %}
```

### Usage
The status badge is automatically generated based on the `is_active` field in the product model.
