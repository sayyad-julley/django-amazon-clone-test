# Product Management

This documentation covers the product management functionality in the Django Ecommerce admin interface.

## Product List Page

The product list page displays all products in the system with search, sort, and pagination features.

### Features

- **Search**: Filter products by name using the search bar
- **Sort**: Sort products by ID, Title, Description, or Created At
- **Pagination**: Navigate through products page by page
- **Product Cards**: Each product displays its image, category, URL slug, and creation date

### Empty State (AGENTIC-117)

When no products exist in the system (or when a search returns no results), the product list page displays a user-friendly message:

```html
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>No products found. <a href="{% url 'product_view' %}">Create your first product!</a></p>
</div>
```

This provides:
- Clear feedback that no products exist
- A direct link to create a new product
- Improved user experience for new users

### Product Actions

Each product card provides the following actions:
- **EDIT**: Modify product details
- **ADD MEDIA**: Add images or media to the product
- **EDIT MEDIA**: Modify existing media
- **ADD Stocks**: Add stock information

## Creating Products

Navigate to the product creation page via the "Create your first product!" link or through the main navigation menu.
