# API Rate Limiting

## Overview

Our Django application implements a robust rate limiting mechanism to protect authentication endpoints from abuse and potential brute-force attacks.

## Rate Limit Strategies

### Authentication Endpoints
- **Limit**: 5 requests per minute
- **Behavior**: Progressive delay with exponential backoff
- **Endpoints**:
  - Login
  - Registration (when implemented)

### Profile and Logout Endpoints
- **Limit**: 10 requests per minute
- **Behavior**: Static rate limit

## How It Works

### IP-Based Tracking
Rate limiting is implemented on a per-IP basis, with multiple methods to detect the client's IP address:
1. X-Forwarded-For header
2. REMOTE_ADDR 

### Progressive Delay Mechanism
When rate limits are exceeded:
- First violation: Block for the remainder of the current minute
- Subsequent violations: Exponential delay (2^n seconds, capped at 1 hour)

## Response Headers

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns:
- **HTTP Status**: 403 Forbidden
- **Retry-After**: Suggested wait time before next request
- **X-RateLimit-Limit**: Maximum number of allowed requests
- **X-RateLimit-Remaining**: Remaining requests in the current window

## Example Rate Limiting Decorator

```python
@strict_auth_rate_limit
def adminLoginProcess(request):
    # Login logic here
    pass
```

## Security Considerations
- Protects against brute-force attacks
- Provides gradual escalation of blocking mechanisms
- Tracks violations across different endpoints

## Customization
Rate limits can be easily adjusted in `DjangoEcommerceApp/utils/rate_limiter.py`.
