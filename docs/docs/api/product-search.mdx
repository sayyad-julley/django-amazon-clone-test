## Product Search API

The product search functionality allows for flexible, case-insensitive searching across multiple product fields.

### Search Parameters

- `q`: The search query parameter
- Supports case-insensitive, partial matching across:
  - Product Name
  - Brand
  - Product Description

### Search Behavior

- **Case Insensitivity**: Search is not affected by letter case
  - Example: "Nike", "NIKE", "nike" will all return Nike products

- **Partial Matching**: Searches match partial strings
  - Example: "run" will match products with running in the description

### Example Queries

```python
# Search by partial product name
GET /admin/products/?q=air

# Search by brand
GET /admin/products/?q=Nike

# Search by description keyword
GET /admin/products/?q=cushioning
```

### Response

- Returns matching products
- Sorted by most recently created first
- Paginated (10 products per page)

### Permissions

- Only accessible to staff or superuser accounts

### Error Handling

- Empty search returns all products
- No matching products returns an empty list
