## Product Rating Field

### Overview
The `average_rating` field provides an automatically calculated average rating for products based on customer reviews.

### Field Specification
- **Type**: DecimalField
- **Max Digits**: 3
- **Decimal Places**: 2
- **Default**: 0.0

### Calculation Method
- Calculated from active product reviews (reviews with `is_active=True`)
- Dynamically updates on review creation, modification, or deletion
- Handles edge cases such as no reviews gracefully

### Usage Example
```python
# Retrieve a product's rating
product = Product.objects.get(id=1)
print(product.average_rating)  # Displays pre-calculated rating
print(product.dynamic_average_rating)  # Re-calculates if stored rating is None

# The rating is automatically updated when reviews are added/modified
review = ProductReview.objects.create(
    product=product,
    customer=user,
    rating=4.5
)
# product.average_rating will be automatically updated
```

### Performance Considerations
- Rating is pre-calculated for optimal query performance
- Fallback dynamic calculation method provides flexibility
- Utilizes Django signals for real-time updates
