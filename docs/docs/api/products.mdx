## Product Rating Field

### Overview

Each product in the system has an `average_rating` field that automatically tracks the average rating from product reviews. 

### Attributes

- `average_rating`: A DecimalField storing the product's average rating
  - Type: Decimal
  - Max Digits: 3
  - Decimal Places: 2
  - Nullable: Yes
  - Blank: Yes
  - Default: None

### Calculation Methods

1. **Cached Average Rating**
   The `average_rating` field is automatically updated whenever a review is added, updated, or deleted.

2. **Dynamic Rating Calculation**
   A `dynamic_average_rating` property method ensures the rating is always up-to-date:
   - Calculates rating from active reviews
   - Returns 0.0 if no reviews exist
   - Rounds to 2 decimal places
   - Updates the cached `average_rating` field if different

### Usage Example

```python
# Get a product's rating
product = Products.objects.get(id=1)
print(product.average_rating)  # Cached rating
print(product.dynamic_average_rating)  # Dynamically calculated rating
```
