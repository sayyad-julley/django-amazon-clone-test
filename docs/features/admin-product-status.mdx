## Overview
The admin product list includes a status badge for each product, visually indicating its active or inactive state.

## Implementation Details
- Badge Style: Bootstrap badge classes
- Active Products: Green `badge-success`

{% if product.is_active == 1 %}
    <span class="badge badge-success">Active</span>
{% else %}
    <span class="badge badge-secondary">Inactive</span>
{% endif %}
```

## Functionality
