# Product Image Lightbox Functionality

## Overview

Added a lightbox feature to the product list view that allows administrators to click on product images to view them in a larger, centered modal.

## Features

- Product images are now clickable in the admin product list
- Clicking an image opens a modal with the full-size image
- Modal displays the product name as its title
- Image is centered and responsive
- Modal can be closed via the X button or clicking outside the modal

## Implementation Details

- Modified `product_list.html` template 
- Added `onclick` event to product images
- Inserted a modal dynamically using JavaScript
- Implemented `openImageLightbox()` function to handle image display

### Technical Changes

- Added `cursor: pointer` style to images
- Created a modal with Bootstrap classes
- Used jQuery for modal triggering (ensures compatibility with existing admin theme)

## Usage

When viewing the product list in the admin panel, simply click on any product image to open the lightbox and view a larger version of the image.
