## Product Deletion

### Confirmation Dialog

A confirmation dialog has been added to the product deletion process to prevent accidental deletions. When a user clicks the "DELETE PRODUCT" button, a JavaScript `confirm()` dialog will appear with the message:

```
Are you sure you want to delete this product?
```

#### Behavior
- If the user clicks "OK", the product deletion will proceed
- If the user clicks "Cancel", the deletion will be cancelled

### Best Practices
- Always review products carefully before deletion
- Confirm the necessity of deleting a product to prevent data loss
- Use the confirmation dialog as a safety mechanism

**Note:** Backend product deletion functionality is currently being implemented.
