## Product Deletion Feature

### Overview
The product deletion feature allows administrators to remove individual products directly from the product list interface.

### Functionality
- Each product card now includes a "DELETE" button
- Clicking the button triggers a confirmation dialog
- Confirmation dialog displays the product name
- Prevents accidental deletions with explicit user consent
- Uses POST method with CSRF protection for secure deletion

### Usage
1. Navigate to the Product List page
2. Locate the product you want to delete
3. Click the "DELETE" button on the product card
4. Confirm deletion in the pop-up dialog

### Technical Implementation
- Implemented in `product_list.html`
- JavaScript `confirmDelete()` function handles dialog and form submission
- Submits deletion via dynamically created form with CSRF token

### Security Considerations
- CSRF token included with each delete request
- Explicit user confirmation required
- POST method prevents accidental or malicious deletions via URL manipulation

### Compatibility
- Works with existing bulk delete functionality
- Maintains current admin interface design and UX
