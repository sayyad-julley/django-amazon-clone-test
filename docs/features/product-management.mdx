## Product Status Badge

In the admin product list, each product now displays a status badge to indicate its current state:

- **Active Products**: Green badge with "Active" text
- **Inactive Products**: Grey badge with "Inactive" text

### Implementation Details

The status is determined by the `is_active` field of the product:
- `is_active == 1`: Shows green "Active" badge
- `is_active == 0`: Shows grey "Inactive" badge

### Usage Example

```html
{% if product.is_active == 1 %}
    <span class="badge badge-success">Active</span>
{% else %}
    <span class="badge badge-secondary">Inactive</span>
{% endif %}
```

This feature provides quick visual identification of product status in the admin product list.
