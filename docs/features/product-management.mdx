## Product Status Badge

For the issue AGENTIC-118, an investigation was conducted on the product list template. 

### Findings
- The existing template (`admin_templates/product_list.html`) already implements the status badge feature as requested.
- Active products are displayed with a green "Active" badge
- Inactive products are displayed with a grey "Inactive" badge
- No code changes were required to meet the issue requirements

### Implementation Details
```html
<td>
    {% if product.product.is_active == 1 %}
        <span class="badge badge-success">Active</span>
    {% else %}
        <span class="badge badge-secondary">Inactive</span>
    {% endif %}
</td>
```

### Verification
- Template checked and confirmed to meet all acceptance criteria
- No modifications were necessary
