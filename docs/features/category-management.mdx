# Category Management Feature: Total Count Display

## Overview
In the admin templates for categories, subcategories, products, and merchant lists, a total count display has been implemented to provide quick visibility into the number of items in each list.

## List Templates with Total Count
The following list templates include a total count display in their header:

1. **Category List**: `Category List <small>(Total: {{ categories_list|length }})</small>`
2. **Subcategory List**: `Sub Category List <small>(Total: {{ subcategories_list|length }})</small>`
3. **Product List**: `Product List <small>(Total: {{ object_list|length }})</small>`
4. **Merchant List**: `Merchant User List <small>(Total: {{ merchantuser_list|length }})</small>`

## Implementation Details
- The total count is dynamically calculated using the Django template `|length` filter
- Displayed in a small tag next to the list title
- Updates automatically based on the current filtered/paginated list

## Benefits
- Provides immediate insight into the number of items
- Helps users quickly understand the scope of the list
- Responsive to filtering and pagination
