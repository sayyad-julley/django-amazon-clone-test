## Character Count Functionality

### Overview
The product creation and editing forms now include a character count indicator for description fields, helping users track their input against the maximum limit of 500 characters.

### Features
- Real-time character count display
- Maximum limit of 500 characters for description fields
- Automatic count update as user types

### Implementation Details
The character count is implemented using:
- HTML `<small>` tag to display the count
- JavaScript event listeners to track input
- Dynamic span element to show current character count

### Usage Example
When creating or editing a product, you'll see a character count below the description textarea:
```
Character count: 0/500
```

As you type, the count will update in real-time to show the current number of characters.
