## Character Count Functionality

The product creation and editing forms include a real-time character count display for description text areas.

### Features

- Shows maximum character limit (500 characters)

- Prevents exceeding maximum character limit

### Implementation Details
- Automatically applied to all textarea fields
- Uses JavaScript to track and update character count
- Provides visual feedback to users about remaining characters

### Example
```html
<textarea class="form-control char-count-input" maxlength="500"></textarea>
<small class="text-muted">Character count: <span id="charCount">0</span>/500</small>
```

### Best Practices
