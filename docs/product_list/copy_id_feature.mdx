## Product ID Copy Functionality

The product list view includes a convenient "Copy" button next to each product ID, enabling users to quickly copy the product identifier to their clipboard.

### Features
- One-click copy of product ID
- Instant visual feedback when ID is copied
- Works across different devices and browsers

### Usage
1. Navigate to the product list view
2. Find the product you want to copy the ID for
3. Click the "Copy" button (📋 icon) next to the product ID
4. A brief "Copied!" message will confirm the action

### Technical Implementation
- Uses vanilla JavaScript `document.execCommand('copy')` method
- Dynamically creates and removes a temporary textarea for copying
- Shows/hides a success message with a 2-second timeout
