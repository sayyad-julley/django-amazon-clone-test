## Authentication Rate Limiting

Our Django application implements a robust, multi-layered rate limiting strategy to protect authentication endpoints from abuse and potential brute-force attacks.

### Key Features

- **IP-Based Tracking**: Rate limits are enforced at the IP address level
- **Progressive Delay**: Exponential backoff for repeated violations
- **Granular Endpoint Controls**: Different rate limits for various authentication actions

### Rate Limit Configurations

#### Login Endpoint
- **Limit**: 5 requests per minute
- **Behavior**: Progressive delay increases with repeated violations
- **Error Response**: 429 Too Many Requests with detailed headers

#### Registration Endpoint
- **Limit**: 3 requests per 5 minutes
- **Behavior**: Progressive delay to prevent mass registrations
- **Error Response**: 429 Too Many Requests with retry guidance

#### Password Reset Endpoint
- **Limit**: 2 requests per hour
- **Behavior**: Strict rate limiting to prevent password reset abuse
- **Error Response**: 429 Too Many Requests with support contact suggestion

### Response Headers

When rate limit is exceeded, responses include:
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before next attempt
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum allowed requests
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when limit resets

### Implementation Details

Rate limiting is implemented using Django's cache and a custom decorator `enhanced_rate_limit()`. 
This allows for flexible, configurable rate limiting across different endpoints.

```python
@strict_auth_rate_limit  # 5 requests per minute with progressive delay
@rest_auth_rate_limit   # Adds additional API-level rate limiting
def adminLoginProcess(request):
    # Authentication logic here
```

### Logging

All rate limit events are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Client IP
- Number of requests
- Violation details

Logs are written to `rate_limit.log` for monitoring and analysis.
