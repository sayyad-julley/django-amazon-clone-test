## Product Rating Field

The `Products` model now includes an `average_rating` field that automatically calculates and updates the average rating from `ProductReviews`.

### Field Specification
- Type: `DecimalField`
- Max Digits: 3
- Decimal Places: 2
- Can be `null` or `blank`

### Calculation Method
1. The rating is automatically updated whenever a review is:
   - Created
   - Updated
   - Deleted

2. A dynamic property `dynamic_average_rating` is also available to calculate the rating on-the-fly.

### Example
```python
# Creating a product
product = Products.objects.create(...)

# Checking average rating
print(product.average_rating)  # 0.0 initially
print(product.dynamic_average_rating)  # 0.0 initially

# Adding reviews
ProductReviews.objects.create(product_id=product, rating=4.5)
ProductReviews.objects.create(product_id=product, rating=5.0)

# Rating will be automatically updated
print(product.average_rating)  # 4.75
print(product.dynamic_average_rating)  # 4.75
```

### Notes
- Ratings are rounded to 2 decimal places
- If no active reviews exist, the rating defaults to 0.0
- The rating updates are handled by Django signals
