## Product Ratings

### Average Rating

Each product now includes an `average_rating` field that provides the aggregated rating from customer reviews.

#### Properties

- `average_rating`: A DecimalField storing the pre-calculated average rating
  - Type: Decimal
  - Max Digits: 3
  - Decimal Places: 2
  - Nullable: Yes

- `dynamic_average_rating`: A property method that calculates the rating on-the-fly if `average_rating` is None
  - Returns current product's rating
  - Calculates from active reviews
  - Returns 0.0 if no reviews exist

#### Rating Calculation

1. Ratings are automatically updated when:
   - A new review is added
   - An existing review is modified
   - A review is deleted

2. Only active reviews (is_active=1) are considered in rating calculation

#### Example Usage

```python
# Get the average rating
product = Products.objects.get(id=product_id)
current_rating = product.average_rating  # Pre-calculated
current_dynamic_rating = product.dynamic_average_rating  # Calculated on-the-fly
```

### Admin Interface

In the Django admin interface, you can view:
- Pre-calculated `average_rating`
