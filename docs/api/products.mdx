## Product Rating

### Average Rating Field

The `Products` model includes an `average_rating` field that automatically calculates the average rating from product reviews.

#### Field Specifications
- **Type**: DecimalField
- **Max Digits**: 3
- **Decimal Places**: 2
- **Default**: 0.0
- **Nullable**: Yes

#### Calculation Logic
- Automatically updates when product reviews are added, updated, or deleted
- Only considers active reviews (is_active=1)
- Fallback method `dynamic_average_rating` calculates rating on-the-fly if the stored field is None

#### Example Usage
```python
# Get product average rating
product = Product.objects.get(id=1)
print(product.average_rating)  # Stored average rating
print(product.dynamic_average_rating)  # On-the-fly calculated rating
```

#### Behavior Notes
- New products start with 0.0 average rating
- Rating is rounded to 2 decimal places
- Inactive reviews are excluded from rating calculation
