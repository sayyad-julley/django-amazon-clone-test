## Product Rating

The `Products` model now includes an `average_rating` field that automatically calculates and tracks the average rating for a product based on its reviews.

### Field Details
- `average_rating`: Decimal field (max_digits=3, decimal_places=2)
- Defaults to 0.0 when no reviews exist
- Automatically updated when product reviews are added, updated, or deleted

### Calculation Method
- Calculated from active product reviews (`is_active=1`)
- Uses `calculate_average_rating()` method which can be called on-demand
- Provides a `dynamic_average_rating` property for real-time rating retrieval
- Signal handlers update the rating whenever reviews change

### Example Usage
```python
# Get a product's current average rating
product = Products.objects.get(id=1)
current_rating = product.average_rating  # Returns current stored rating

# Get dynamic rating calculation
live_rating = product.dynamic_average_rating  # Calculates rating on-the-fly
```

### Performance Considerations
- The `average_rating` field is pre-calculated and stored for performance
- `dynamic_average_rating` provides a fallback for real-time calculations
- Signal handlers ensure the stored rating is always up-to-date

### Admin Interface
- The average rating is read-only in the admin interface
- Displayed in the product list view
- Automatically updated by signal handlers
