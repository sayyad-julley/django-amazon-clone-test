# Product Search Functionality

## Overview

The product search functionality allows users to find products by searching across multiple fields with flexible and case-insensitive matching.

## Search Fields

The search supports the following fields:
- Product Name
- Product Description
- Brand

## Search Behavior

### Case Insensitivity
- Searches are case-insensitive
- Examples:
  - "Nike" matches "nike", "NIKE", "NiKe"
  - "running" matches "RUNNING", "Running", "rUnNiNg"

### Partial Match
- Supports partial matches across all searchable fields
- Examples:
  - "nik" finds Nike products
  - "run" finds running-related products
  - "foot" finds products with "football" in description

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Search

```javascript
// Sample search input
const searchQuery = 'Nike';
```

### Backend Query

```python
# Django ORM search query
Products.objects.filter(
    Q(product_name__icontains=search_query) |
    Q(product_description__icontains=search_query) |
    Q(brand__icontains=search_query)
)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Uses Django's `icontains` for case-insensitive, partial matching
- Indexes on `product_name`, `product_description`, and `brand` fields recommended for optimal performance
