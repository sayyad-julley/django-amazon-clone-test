## Product Search Functionality

The product search provides a flexible and user-friendly way to find products across multiple fields.

### Search Capabilities

- **Case-Insensitive Searching**: Matches products regardless of letter case
- **Multi-Field Search**: Search across product name, description, and brand
- **Partial Matching**: Find products with partial matches

### Search Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `filter` | Search term for matching products | `?filter=nike` |

### Search Behavior

1. **Name Search**: Matches products with names containing the search term
   - Example: `?filter=running` finds "Nike Running Shoes"

2. **Brand Search**: Matches products with brands containing the search term
   - Example: `?filter=adidas` finds all Adidas products

3. **Description Search**: Matches products with descriptions containing the search term
   - Example: `?filter=performance` finds products with performance-related descriptions

### Examples

```python
# Case-insensitive search
GET /product-list?filter=nike  # Matches "Nike", "NIKE", "nIkE"

# Partial match search
GET /product-list?filter=run   # Matches "Running Shoes"

# Multi-field search
GET /product-list?filter=performance athlete  # Matches across multiple fields
```

### Pagination

- Default: 3 products per page
- Search results maintain standard pagination

### Error Handling

- Empty search returns all products
- No matching results returns an empty list

### Performance Considerations

The search is implemented using Django's `icontains` lookup, which provides efficient case-insensitive partial matching across multiple fields.
