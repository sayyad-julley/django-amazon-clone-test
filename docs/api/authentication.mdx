# Authentication API Rate Limiting

## Overview
The authentication API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against brute-force attacks.

## Rate Limit Policy
- **Endpoints**: Registration and Login
- **Limit**: 5 requests per minute per IP address
- **Mechanism**: Sliding window rate limiting
- **Behavior**: Progressive delay for repeated violations

## Rate Limit Headers
When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns:
- `429 Too Many Requests` status code
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before next request
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum allowed requests
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window

### Example Rate Limit Response
```json
{
  "error": "Authentication API rate limit exceeded. Please wait and retry."
}
```

## Best Practices
- Implement client-side backoff strategies
- Cache credentials to minimize repeated login attempts
- Use secure, memorable passwords to reduce login failures

## Implementation Details
- Uses Django's cache framework for distributed rate limiting
- IP-based tracking with multiple header support
- Progressive delay to deter repeated abuse
