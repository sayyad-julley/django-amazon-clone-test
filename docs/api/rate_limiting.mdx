# API Rate Limiting

## Authentication Endpoints Rate Limiting

The Django Amazon Clone application implements robust rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and ensure system stability.

### Rate Limit Configurations

#### Authentication Login Process
- **Decorator**: `@strict_auth_rate_limit`
- **Limit**: 5 requests per minute
- **Features**:
  - IP-based tracking
  - Progressive delay for repeated violations
  - Detailed logging of rate limit events

#### REST API Authentication
- **Decorator**: `@rest_auth_rate_limit`
- **Limit**: 5 requests per minute
- **Features**:
  - Complementary to `strict_auth_rate_limit`
  - Provides an additional layer of rate limiting
  - Helps prevent automated attack attempts

### Implementation Details

The rate limiting is implemented using a sliding window algorithm with the following characteristics:
- Uses Django's cache backend for tracking request timestamps
- Normalizes IP addresses for accurate tracking
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
- Provides configurable request limits and time windows

### Headers on Rate Limit Violation

When a rate limit is exceeded, the following HTTP headers are returned:
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before next request
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum allowed requests
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when the current window resets

### Logging

Rate limit events are logged with the following information:
- Client IP address
- Request count
- Time window
- Violation count (for progressive delay)

### Best Practices
- Implement rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints
- Use different rate limit configurations for different endpoint types
- Monitor and adjust limits based on application usage patterns
