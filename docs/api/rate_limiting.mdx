## Overview

Rate limiting is a critical security mechanism that protects our authentication and registration endpoints from potential abuse, brute-force attacks, and unintended system overload.

## Rate Limit Configurations

Our rate limiting strategy provides granular control across different authentication endpoints:

### Login Endpoint
- **Maximum Requests**: 5 requests per minute
- **Scope**: Per IP address
- **Mechanism**: Progressive delay with exponential backoff
- **Response**: 
  - HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit is exceeded
  - `Retry-After` header indicates delay before next attempt

### Registration Endpoint
- **Maximum Requests**: 3 requests per 5 minutes
- **Scope**: Per IP address
- **Mechanism**: Progressive delay to prevent mass account creation
- **Response**: 
  - HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit is exceeded
  - `Retry-After` header indicates delay before next attempt

### Response Headers

All rate-limited responses include informative headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum allowed requests
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before next request

## Implementation Details

### IP-Based Tracking
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- Multiple proxy header detection (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP)
- Normalization to prevent bypass attempts

### Progressive Delay Mechanism
The delay between requests increases exponentially after repeated violations:
1. First violation: Immediate retry allowed
2. Subsequent violations: Increasing wait times
3. Maximum delay: 1 hour

## Best Practices

1. Handle rate limit responses gracefully in client applications
2. Implement client-side backoff and retry logic
3. Log and monitor rate limit events for security insights

## Example Client Handling

```python
def login_with_retry(username, password):
    try:
        response = login_api_call(username, password)
    except RateLimitError as e:
        retry_after = e.headers.get('Retry-After')
        time.sleep(int(retry_after))
        # Retry login after specified delay
        response = login_api_call(username, password)
```

## Security Considerations

- Rate limiting helps prevent:
  - Brute-force password attempts
  - Credential stuffing attacks
  - Account enumeration
  - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
