## Clear Filter Button

In the category and subcategory list pages, a "Clear" button has been added next to the search input field. 

### Functionality
- Located immediately after the search button
- Clears all applied filters
- Resets the page to show all items
- Uses a secondary button style with a times (×) icon

### Usage
When users want to quickly reset their search or filter, they can click the "Clear" button to restore the full list of categories or subcategories.

### Implementation Details
- URL Routing: Directs to the base list page without any filter parameters
- Icon: Uses Font Awesome's `fas fa-times` for visual clarity
- Consistent across both category and subcategory list pages
