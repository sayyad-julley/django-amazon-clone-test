## Bulk Product Selection

The product list page now supports bulk selection of products with a new "Select All" checkbox feature.

### Features
- "Select All" checkbox in the table header
- Individual checkboxes for each product
- Supports bulk actions like deletion

### Usage
1. Click the "Select All" checkbox to select/deselect all products
2. Alternatively, select individual products as needed
3. Use the "Bulk Delete" button to perform actions on selected products

### Technical Implementation
- Added JavaScript function `toggleAllProducts()` to handle checkbox selection
- Implemented form with CSRF token for secure bulk actions
- Uses Django's form submission to handle bulk operations
